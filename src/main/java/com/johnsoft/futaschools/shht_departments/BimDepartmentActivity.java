                "WELCOME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BIO-MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY",
        "The Department of Biomedical Technology (BMT) is one among the three pioneering departments of the School of Health and Health Technology (SHHT), FUTA, which was established in 2015. Biomedical Technology being a multidisciplinary course, the Department was created with the core principle of producing graduates that can be readily absorbed into several areas of the rapidly developing fields of Biomedical Technology. Students are expected to be exposed to intense programme of basic and applied courses, broad range of engineering courses, experimentation, projects and industrial training. These are designed to enable students satisfy the manpower and growing needs of Biomedical Technologists/Engineers in the public, private and industrial sectors of the economy both locally and internationally. Being a nascent and multidisciplinary department, we admitted our first set of 67 students during the 2015/2016 academic session. During the 2016/2017 academic session, the Department admitted another set of 31 students, thus bring the total number of students to 98. The Department started its operation from the School of Sciences Extension building temporary assigned to SHHT by the University. In line with the vision and mission of the University, the Departmentâ€™s staff members are highly committed to the training of Biomedical Technology students with the core vision of promoting technology for self-reliance.\n" +

                "The philosophy of the Federal University of Technology, Akure is to produce technologically oriented graduates. In line with this philosophy, the Department trains graduates with a broad based knowledge in various aspects of Biomedical Technology with a bias towards biology, engineering and medicine. The undergraduate programme is designed to produce graduates that can be readily absorbed into several areas of the rapidly developing fields of Biomedical Technology. Students are exposed to intense programme of basic and applied courses, experimentation, projects and industrial training. These are designed to enable them satisfy the manpower and growing needs of Biomedical Engineers and Technologists in the public and industrial sectors of the economy. The programme involves research and training in the following areas: Biomedical instrumentation and intelligent biomedical systems control engineering; neurosciences; Biotechnology and Biomedicine; Nervous and Clinical Engineering, Rehabilitation Engineering. The thrust is to emphasize aspects of study that are relevant to articulated national and international development objectives and those that enhance the relevance of institution to the society. At the end of the programme, the products will be suitable for employment in all relevant public and private enterprises both in Nigeria and the world at large. The general philosophy of the programme is to produce graduates of high academic standing with adequate practical exposure who can function adequately in the medical education process, complement ancillary laboratory medical services to the greater society and develop entrepreneurial expertise in related disciplines."));
