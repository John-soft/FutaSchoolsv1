The Department was established to give prominent scientific training and provide the much â€“ needed impetus to rapid industrial chemistry. The programme is expected to emphasize on the practical aspects of Industrial Chemistry with the aim of proffering solutions to problems encountered in manufacturing and service industries. Currently, the departmental undergraduate academic programmes are organized under B. Tech (Industrial Chemistry) with emphasis on the following specializations; dye and textile , food, polymer and plastic, wood, pulp and paper, instrumentation and chemical analysis, petroleum and mineral processing chemistry.\n" +

Tech.), Masters of Technology (M.Tech) in Analytical Chemistry and M.Tech in Industrial Chemistry, Professional Master of Technology in Environmental Chemistry, Master of philosophy (M. Phil.) and Doctor of Philosophy in any field of Chemistry. However, the M.Tech. in Environmental Chemistry and Master of Philosophy programmes are the newly proposed initiatives. The department is well equipped with both academic and technological manpower to undertake these programmes. The products of the department are most sought after by reputable employers nationwide.\n" +
